Start off with:

a written overview of the company it's for
a rationale for the work carried out
information about logos; font usage; colour palette; tone of voice
photographic guides
collateral information
If you have enough time, it's worth adding some examples of logo and typographic usage as well as links to master artwork/ brand collateral templates and helpful contacts within your agency or company.
--------------------
Name your design style guide something like Styleguide_lite_v0.1 and explain to your client that this is the “lite” (sic) guide to working with the brand, which is suitable for everyday creative use. Should they wish for an additional more thorough version this can be classed as a separate project… with a separate budget.
----------------------
Your guide will be severely lacking if it doesn't include the artwork mentioned in it. Create a repository online for all brand materials and index these by category so they make sense.

One great big list of brand asset download links is of no real help to anyone. Create categories relevant to your style guide and add the links there. Cross link between pdf or web pages to each download as well as having this separate “Download” area.

Add version numbers and dates to template file names which are likely to update over time and do the same with your style guide.
-----------------------
Art-working up examples of creative templates can be a great way to showcase how the guide can be interpreted. Also consider supplying these files for download with the style guide.
-------------------------
Oh and if your brand font is bespoke, supply it. If it's available from a font library, give out the download link.  Don't distribute fonts you have no rights to do so for.
